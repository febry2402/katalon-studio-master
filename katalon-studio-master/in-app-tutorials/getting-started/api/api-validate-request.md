###  Validate your Web Service Requests    

**Verification** is where you define the assertion to ensure the response will contain the expected information. The panel on the right of the request is the response displayed in nice format automatically and the result of verification at Verification Log.

To validate the response after sending a request, select the **Test Request and Verify** option of the execution button.

You can add more assertions to the test case or write custom scripts with built-in keywords or Groovy/Java scripts to verify the response data. Katalon Studio also supports [built-in snippets](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/verification-snippets.html), which help you to generate assertions with a single click.
