## Run test and investigate execution result

### Run your test

> Turn on the WinAppDriver before running a test case.

1. Open a test case
2. Click on the arrow right next to the **Run** button and select **Windows**

   The **Job Progress** is triggered automatically to show the progress while your test case runs.

### Investigate execution result

If your test has passed, congratulate. Now you can move to the next step by clicking **Next** on the bottom right corner.

If your test has failed, don't worry; let's investigate the root cause and rerun your test. Have a look at **Log Viewer** and **Console** tabs to know what happened during runtime. You should see the root cause informed by Katalon on top of the execution log.
